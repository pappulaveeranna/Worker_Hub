🚀 NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT - STEP BY STEP

✅ Your build is ready at:
   c:\Users\pappula veeranna\Desktop\work_backend\frontend\frontend_ui\build

📦 HOW TO DEPLOY:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/drop

2. Open File Explorer and navigate to:
   c:\Users\pappula veeranna\Desktop\work_backend\frontend\frontend_ui\build

3. Drag ONLY the "build" folder contents (or the entire build folder) to the Netlify drop zone

4. Wait for deployment to complete

5. You'll get a URL like: https://random-name-123456.netlify.app

⚙️ AFTER DEPLOYMENT:

1. Go to Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add this variable:
   - Key: REACT_APP_API_URL
   - Value: YOUR_BACKEND_URL/api (e.g., https://your-backend.onrender.com/api)

3. Redeploy the site for changes to take effect

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Your backend is NOT deployed yet (still needs MongoDB connection)
- Deploy backend first on Render.com or Railway.app
- Then update REACT_APP_API_URL with your backend URL
- The _redirects file is included to fix React Router issues

📝 BACKEND DEPLOYMENT (Choose one):

Option 1 - Render.com (Recommended):
1. Go to https://render.com
2. New → Web Service
3. Connect GitHub or upload backend folder
4. Build: cd backend && npm install
5. Start: cd backend && npm start
6. Add environment variables:
   - MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxxx.mongodb.net/workerhub?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   - JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_12345
   - PORT=5000

Option 2 - Railway.app:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. New Project → Deploy from GitHub
3. Add same environment variables

🔗 FINAL STEP:
After backend is deployed, update frontend's REACT_APP_API_URL in Netlify!
